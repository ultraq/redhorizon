This repository is an archive of work I did several years ago to attempt to
recreate the orignal 2D Command & Conquer (C&C) games.  The most useful outcome
of this project has been a set of file conversion tools and working code
examples of how to decode/encode various file formats from those games.

While I don't think I have the time any more to fulfil the original goal of
running the original Red Alert campaign missions with this (there's that [C&C
Remaster project](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-remastered)
now!), I update this project every so often when I feel the urge to work on
smaller things like graphics rendering, playing sounds, creating good CLI tools,
and general software architecture for games as opposed to my day-to-day which is
web development.

These smaller goals can be observed as [milestones](https://github.com/ultraq/redhorizon/milestones)
on GitHub, so you can follow along there.
