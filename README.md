This repository is an archive of work I did several years ago to attempt to
recreate the orignal 2D Command & Conquer (C&C) games.  The most useful outcome
of this project has been a set of file conversion tools and working code
examples of how to decode/encode various file formats from those games.

While I am no longer updating this project, I've left this code up here to act
as a reference for anybody else wishing to develop file readers or other code
that needs to interact with those old file formats.

All I'm doing with this now is updating it to work as an importable JAR file for
those who want to use this code in JVM-based projects, and trying to replicate
the download bundles that used to host the Windows command-line tools for file
conversion.
