 * A class similar to what the {@link ByteBuffer#duplicate()} method does in
 * that this class creates a new {@link SeekableByteChannel} instance over an
 * existing {@link SeekableByteChannel} so that it shares the same data but
 * maintains its own position and limit, so as not to mess with the original
 * byte channel's position/limit.
 * <p>
 * While closing this channel has no effect, closing the original will close
 * this duplicate.
